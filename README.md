Problem Statement :

"Develop a machine learning model to predict the sales of the Rossmann store chain based on historical data and relevant features. The objective is to accurately forecast the future sales of each store in order to optimize inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies. The model should consider factors such as store-specific information, promotional activities, competition, seasonality, and other relevant variables.
